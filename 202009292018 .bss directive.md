# .bss directive

BSS = Block Started By Symbol
```
.bss subsection
```

Is used to define to put data at the end of the particular `.bss` subsection (0 if not defined). Used for data which needs to be initialzed as zero. This can also be used to save space, as it does not take up any space in the memory. All the bits are set to 0 in this section.
