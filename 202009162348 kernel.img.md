# kernel.img

Since raspberry pi loads `kernel.img` which contains our ARM bootcode[^1], as well as our kernel. We don't need to think about how to move our bootloader and kernel to flash. So it'll act more like a floppy bootloader.

[^1]: EDIT: It does not contain our ARM bootcode, just the kernel. There is no such thing as a bootloader in ARM in raspberry pi
