# FreeCode Camp
- Freecode Camp does the job of telling you exactly what to do, and does not induce curiosity or will to learn.
- Can be thought of as busy work: very little retention
 
There must be a reason to learn a tool, in order to best utilize a resource[^1]. So aimless completion of challenges will amount to little knowledge, inspiration to do work
