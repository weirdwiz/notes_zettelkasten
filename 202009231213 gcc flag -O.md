`-O` signifies the optimisation level of the code to compiler.

### `O0` 
Optimises for compile time and memory, so the execution time and the code size increases but memory usage and compile time reduces.
### `O1`
Optimises for code size and execution time
### `O2`
Optimises for more for code size and execution itme
### `O3`
very fast execution time 

increasing opimisations for execution time, we increase the compilation time and memory usage.
